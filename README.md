# Mobile Fitness App made with Ionic 4 and Angular 7

## How to run it
First of all, make sure the latest version of Node.js and npm are installed.
Then install the Ionic CLI globally with **npm install -g ionic**.
Change directory to the where the app is located on your system and run **ionic serve**, this will run the app on your browser.
To view the app as it is intended, I recommended that you change the view to a mobile device using Inspect(Ctrl+Shift+I) followed by Ctrl+Shift+M to toggle the device toolbar in Google Chrome.

## Navigating through the mobile app
As of this iteration, the login/registration on the app is not functional therefore to proceed to the dashboard you will need to change the url to end with /dashboard instead of /login. The other views in the app can be reached via the buttons in the app.
